2)parsing of the username,email id & password using regular expressions
3)sending activation email via gmail stmp
4)activation of account within 5 days of registering
5)creation of a random digit number assigned to every user who registers
6) denies creation of account to user aged less than 14 years of age.


Uniqueness in this registration : Assigning the random 9 digit number to every user, instead of username gives an anonymity to the site in which this registration & login is deployed.
