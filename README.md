Registration-Login-
===================

This is the php code for registration and login page which offers the following features:
-getting the data such as username,date of birth,email id,password,mobile number,education & institution
-parsing of the username,email id & password using regular expressions
-sending activation email via gmail stmp
-activation of account within 7 days of registering
-creation of a random digit number assigned to every user who registers

Assigning the random 9 digit number to every user, instead of username gives an anonymity to the site in which this registration & login is deployed.
